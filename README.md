# Learn BOSH on GCP Release

This learn-bosh-on-gcp-release repository builds upon the [learn-bosh-release](https://github.com/mariash/learn-bosh-release) repository developed by [Maria Shaldibina](https://github.com/mariash) for her excellent [A Guide to Using BOSH](http://mariash.github.io/learn-bosh/) tutorial.

While the release in Maria's repository is targeted at BOSH Lite being used locally, the release in this repository targets BOSH running in Google Cloud Platform.
